        "For nights I had been dreaming about that ruined house, imagining what might be inside. One night, in one of my dreams, I glimpsed an unrecognizable human figure. The only thing I could decipher in that enigmatic dream was the call of that entity. It whispered, -Help me!!, help me!!-. \n From that moment, I could wait no longer. I had to enter that abandoned house, despite the warnings around it."
